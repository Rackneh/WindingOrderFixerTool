## Usage
 
Install unity Editor 2022.3

	// If you are following the MGS3VR instructions you can ignore this.

Step 1 

	Copy the folder of the assets you want to have fixed

Step 2

	Paste the folders into the "Assets/Import/" folder of this tool

Step 3

	Run the tool (if it crashes while running refer to Step 3.5), when it's done copy the Import and Export folders to a new temporary mod folder.

Step 3.5

	If it crashed while running: check until which folder in the hierarchy got Exported and then move those UP UNTIL THE LAST ONE EXPORTED out of the Import folder.
	The folder it crashed on should be gone over again.

Step 4

	in the temporary mod folder, copy the folders from the Export and paste them onto the same folders inside of the Import. This will override the broken models with the fixed models
